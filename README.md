### Random API - Anime Explorer
## Website Link: https://randomapianime.netlify.app/

A responsive web application built with Vite that allows users to search for and explore anime using the Jikan API.

This project uses the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), an unofficial MyAnimeList API that provides access to anime and manga data. The API is free to use and does not require authentication.
The application handles API rate limiting by implementing delays between successive requests when necessary.
